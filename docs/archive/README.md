## Why These Files Were Archived

These documents were archived during a documentation consolidation effort on 2025-11-15 to:

1. **Remove duplicates** - Multiple versions of the same document existed
2. **Update outdated content** - ROADMAP and SECURITY docs were significantly out of date
3. **Consolidate scattered docs** - Documentation was split between root and docs/
4. **Improve clarity** - Having a single source of truth for each topic
